## Project Setup

The project is built on top of Next.js and uses Node.js (v10+) and Yarn. These are the only dependencies.

## Runing

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server on port 3000.

## Testing

Tests are stored in the `tests/` directory. The test coverage only covers a couple of files - they are there more as examples than for broad test coverage.

To run the test

```bash
yarn test
```

## Linting

Linting is done by `eslint`. You can run it by

```bash
yarn lint
```
